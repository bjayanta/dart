/**
 * Stream:
 * 
 * A stream is a sequence of asynchronous events representing multiple values that will arrive in the future. 
 * Stream class deals with sequences of events instead of single events. 
 * Stream has one or more listeners, and all listeners will receive the same value. 
 * For E.g A stream is like a pipe, you put a value on the one end, 
 * and if thereâ€™s a listener on the other end that listener will receive that value.
