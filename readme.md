# Operators

- What is operators?
- Operands(represents the data) & Operator(represents how the operands will be processed to produce a value)
- Types Of Operators :
  - Arithmetic
  - Increment and Decrement
  - Assignment
  - Relational
  - Logical
  - Type Test Operators

## Arithmetic Operators

| Operator Symbol | Operator Name |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| + | Addition |
| - | Subtraction |
| -expr | Unary Minus (For reversing the sign of the expression) |
| * | Multiplication |
| / | Division (For dividing two operands and give output in double) |

| % | Modulus |
| ++ | Increment |
| -- | Decrement |
