/**
 * Dart does not support multiple inheritance because it can lead to ambiguity. 
 * For example, if class Apple inherits class Fruit and class Vegetable, 
 * then there may be two methods with the same name eat. 
 * If the method is called, then which method should be called? 
 * This is the reason why Dart does not support multiple inheritance.
